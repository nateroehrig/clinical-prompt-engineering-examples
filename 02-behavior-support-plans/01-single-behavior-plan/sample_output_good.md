# Behavior Support Plan for Aiden

This plan is based on the structured information provided about Aiden’s strengths, his out-of-seat behavior during independent work, and the patterns observed across multiple ABC examples. The goal is to help Aiden stay engaged in his tasks, feel supported, and gradually learn strategies that increase his independence.

---

## Overview

Aiden is an energetic and curious third-grade student who loves science experiments and benefits from visual supports and positive adult attention. He sometimes leaves his seat during independent tasks, which interrupts his learning and requires teacher redirection. ABC data suggests this behavior is most likely maintained by **access to adult attention**. When Aiden leaves his seat, adults often come over to help, which unintentionally reinforces the behavior.

This plan focuses on proactive supports, teaching alternative skills, and responding in ways that guide Aiden toward more successful, independent work habits.

## Aiden’s Strengths

- Curious and highly motivated by hands-on learning
- Responds well to **visual schedules** and predictable routines
- Enjoys positive attention from adults
- Capable of staying engaged when tasks feel structured and manageable

These strengths are leveraged throughout the plan.

## Target Behavior

**Behavior:** Leaving seat during independent work

**Operational definition:**  
Aiden gets up from his seat and walks around the room for more than 5 seconds during assigned independent tasks.

**Current levels:**  
- Approximately **7 times per day**  
- Average duration: **25 seconds**  
- Severity: mild but interfering with work completion

---

## Likely Function of Behavior

Across the ABC samples, a consistent pattern emerges:

- **Antecedent:** Independent work begins  
- **Behavior:** Aiden leaves his seat  
- **Consequence:** Teacher provides help or redirection  

**Hypothesized function:** Access to adult attention.

Aiden may be seeking reassurance, clarity, or connection during tasks that feel challenging or open-ended.

## Setting the Child Up for Success (Prevention Strategies)

These strategies make the environment clearer, more predictable, and more supportive so Aiden is less likely to leave his seat.

### 1. Provide a simple visual “Work Steps” card
Show Aiden his steps:
1. Start task  
2. Try one problem or section  
3. Use help card if stuck  
4. Take a short break when finished  

This increases clarity and reduces the need to seek help by leaving his seat.

### 2. Give a pre-correction before work begins
Right before independent work:
“Aiden, remember to put your help card on your desk if you need me. I’ll be by in just a minute.”

This anticipates his needs and provides reassurance.

### 3. Schedule predictable adult check-ins
Plan two short check-ins each independent work period:
- At the start  
- Midway through the task  

Aiden benefits from brief connection and reassurance.

### 4. Model or scaffold the first problem
Provide a quick example or guided start so Aiden can enter the task confidently.

## Teaching Replacement Behaviors

We want to give Aiden appropriate, effective ways to get help or attention without leaving his seat.

### 1. Teach the “Help Card”
Demonstrate how to:
- Place the card on the corner of his desk  
- Keep working while waiting  
- Ask brief, clear questions when the adult arrives  

Role-play is essential.

### 2. Practice short “stay in seat” intervals
Use short timed intervals (3–5 minutes).  
Reinforce success with:
- Specific praise  
- Helping with science materials  
- Other positive attention  

Gradually increase the interval.

### 3. Teach simple help-seeking phrases
Examples:
“I need help on this one.”  
“Can you check my work?”

Reinforce these immediately when used.

## Adult Responses When the Behavior Happens

### When Aiden leaves his seat
Respond briefly and neutrally:
“Aiden, return to your seat. I’ll check in soon.”

Avoid reteaching or long conversations in that moment.

### When Aiden uses replacement behaviors
Respond quickly and warmly:
“Nice job using your help card. Let me see how I can help.”

### When Aiden works independently
Use frequent, specific praise:
“You’re sticking with your work and showing great focus.”

This reinforces the behavior we want to strengthen.

## Progress Monitoring

Track the following data for 2–3 weeks:

1. **Frequency** of out-of-seat behavior  
2. **Use of help card** or other replacement behaviors  
3. **On-task duration** during short timed intervals  

Review data weekly to adjust strategies as needed.

---

## Summary

Aiden is a bright, curious child with strong motivation and responsiveness to structure. This plan uses clear visuals, predictable adult support, and direct teaching of replacement skills to help him succeed during independent work. By combining proactive strategies, skill building, and consistent adult responses, Aiden can make meaningful progress toward staying in his seat and engaging more confidently with classroom tasks.
