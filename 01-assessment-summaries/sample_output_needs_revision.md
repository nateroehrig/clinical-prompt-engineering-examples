# Sample Output: Needs Revision

## Overview of Evaluation

The child was assessed to determine whether they have ADHD and a reading disorder. Based on the results of the evaluation, it is clear that the child likely meets criteria for both conditions. The scores on the WISC-V show significant weaknesses that directly explain the academic concerns.

## Strengths

The child is kind and tries hard. They enjoy some activities at school and can do well when they are focused. Their visual skills are probably fine because they seemed to like puzzles.

## Areas of Need

The child struggles with attention most of the time. They also have issues with memory and processing information. Reading is very difficult for them and will continue to be a challenge unless they receive special interventions. Their working memory problems make it hard for them to learn new content in school.

## What This Looks Like Day to Day

Most days, the child is probably forgetful and needs reminders. They might also be very slow at work because processing speed is low. They may also not finish assignments on time. The reading problems are severe and will likely affect all subjects.
