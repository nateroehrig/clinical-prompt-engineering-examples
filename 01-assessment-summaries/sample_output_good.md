# Sample Output: High-Quality Parent Summary

## Overview of Evaluation

Your child participated in a developmental and academic assessment to better understand their learning strengths and areas where they may need support. This evaluation included cognitive testing (WISC-V), academic testing (WIAT-III), behavior rating scales from both home and school, and classroom observations. Together, these results help create a fuller picture of how your child thinks, learns, and manages daily tasks.

## Strengths

- **Visual–spatial reasoning** is an area of strength. Your child does well when working with pictures, patterns, and hands-on tasks.  
- **Verbal comprehension** is within the average range, showing solid ability to understand language and express ideas.  
- Your child shows **effort, persistence, and resilience** during testing, even when tasks were difficult.  
- Stronger performance in **written expression** suggests they have good potential when material is not time-pressured.

## Areas of Need

- **Processing speed** is below average. This means tasks that require working quickly, especially with written material, may be harder.  
- **Working memory** is also below average. Your child may have difficulty holding information in mind long enough to complete multi-step directions.  
- **Reading fluency** and **basic reading skills** are areas of academic weakness. Slow, effortful reading can make schoolwork more challenging and may affect confidence.  
- Attention concerns were noted both at home and school, and during classroom observation your child needed frequent redirection.

## What This Looks Like Day to Day

You may notice your child:

- Needs extra time to start or finish tasks  
- Loses track of steps, instructions, or materials  
- Gets frustrated more quickly with reading tasks  
- Reads slowly and may avoid reading when possible  
- Appears capable during discussion but struggles when tasks require speed or multiple steps  

These patterns are consistent with challenges in processing speed, working memory, and reading fluency.

## How I Can Support My Child at Home

1. **Break tasks into small, simple steps.** Give one direction at a time when possible.  
2. **Use visual supports**, such as checklists or picture cues, to help with routines.  
3. **Practice reading in short, low-pressure bursts**, using material your child enjoys to build confidence.  
4. **Give extra time** for transitions or tasks requiring writing or reading.  
5. **Provide repetition and reassurance**, especially when new or multi-step tasks are involved.

## How School Can Help

1. **Provide extended time** for reading, writing, and independent work.  
2. **Offer repeated or simplified directions**, and check for understanding before your child begins work.  
3. **Use structured reading supports**, such as small-group phonics or fluency instruction.  
4. **Allow use of visual aids**, graphic organizers, or checklists to support working memory.  
5. **Reduce speeded demands** when possible so performance reflects understanding rather than speed.
