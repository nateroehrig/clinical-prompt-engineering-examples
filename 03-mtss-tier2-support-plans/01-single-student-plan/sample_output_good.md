# Tier 2 Student Support Plan for Jordan

## 1. Summary of Strengths
- Strong verbal reasoning skills that support participation during class discussions.
- Contributes meaningfully in group tasks and collaborates well with peers.
- Responds positively to adult encouragement and brief check-ins.
- Highly engaged during hands-on activities, especially in science.

## 2. Core Concern (Non-Deficit Statement)
Jordan benefits from additional support to remain engaged and complete independent classwork consistently, especially during longer or multi-step assignments.

## 3. Observed Patterns
- Engagement decreases during extended independent work time.
- Frequently begins tasks but stops working when unsure how to proceed.
- Demonstrates stronger follow-through when tasks are broken into smaller components.
- More engaged when teacher checks in early in the work period.
- Avoids assignments that feel overwhelming or lack clear structure.

## 4. Likely Barriers or Contributing Factors
Jordan may be experiencing difficulty with task initiation and breaking larger assignments into manageable steps. Uncertainty about expectations may lead to avoidance, especially when peers are nearby and asking for help feels uncomfortable. Limited opportunities for early teacher check-ins may further contribute to work avoidance or stalled progress.

## 5. Tier 2 Intervention Plan (6–8 Weeks)

### Strategy 1: Structured Task Breakdowns
**Teacher will:**  
- Provide a brief checklist outlining 2–4 steps for independent assignments.  
- Model the first step when necessary.  

**Student will:**  
- Follow the checklist and mark each step as completed.  

**When/How Often:**  
- Used for all independent tasks longer than 10 minutes, daily.

---

### Strategy 2: Early Check-In Routine
**Teacher will:**  
- Conduct a brief (10–20 seconds) check-in with Jordan within the first 3 minutes of independent work time.  

**Student will:**  
- State the first step they plan to complete and begin working.  

**When/How Often:**  
- Once per independent work period, as feasible.

---

### Strategy 3: “Help Signal” Procedure
**Teacher will:**  
- Provide a discrete help signal option (e.g., placing a sticky note in the top corner of the desk).  

**Student will:**  
- Use the help signal when stuck instead of stopping work.  

**When/How Often:**  
- Available during all independent work sessions.

---

### Strategy 4: Timed Work Intervals
**Teacher will:**  
- Offer a timer for short work intervals (4–6 minutes).  

**Student will:**  
- Work for the timed interval, then check off progress on the checklist.  

**When/How Often:**  
- Used for longer or multi-step assignments, 2–3 times per week.

## 6. Progress Monitoring

### Method 1: Work Completion Rate
- **What is measured:** Percentage of assigned independent tasks completed.  
- **When:** Tracked daily; reviewed weekly.  
- **Criteria:** Improvement toward consistent completion of 80 percent or more of independent tasks.

### Method 2: On-Task Behavior Intervals
- **What is measured:** Whether Jordan is engaged (working, writing, reading, or signaling for help) during 2–3 teacher-observed intervals.  
- **When:** Twice weekly.  
- **Criteria:** Increasing on-task engagement during observed intervals.

## 7. Review Timeline
Progress will be reviewed at the end of the 8-week intervention cycle to determine whether Jordan is ready to transition back to Tier 1 su
